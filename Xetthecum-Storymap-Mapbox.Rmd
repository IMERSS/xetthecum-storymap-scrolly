## Land Acknowledgement

In the spirit of respect and gratitude, we acknowledge that Xetthecum (Retreat Cove), Galiano Island resides within the trans-boundary bioregion of the Salish Sea, a pristine expanse that has been tended to and cherished by the Coast Salish people since time immemorial. The island rests within the shared, asserted, and unceded traditional territories of the Penelakut, Lamalcha, and Hwlitsum First Nations, as well as the shared, asserted, and ceded traditional territories of Tsawwassen First Nation. Additionally, we acknowledge the territories of all other Hul’q’umi’num’-speaking peoples who hold rights and responsibilities in this region.

<div class="data-pane">
<p>As residents on Galiano Island and learners in this work, we are grateful for the opportunity to be a part of the intricate tapestry of cultural and ecological diversity that weaves us together in this place. We commit to acknowledging the history and ongoing presence of Indigenous Peoples in this area and strive to foster relationships that honor and respect the rights, traditions, and contributions of the Coast Salish and Hul’q’umi’num’-speaking peoples.</p>

<p>May our work on this digital ecocultural mapping project and presence on this island contribute to a future that recognizes the importance of reconciliation, collaboration, and the rightful place of Indigenous knowledge in shaping the well-being of the Salish Sea and its inhabitants.</p>

## Introduction

Welcome to Xetthecum, an area on Galiano Island BC of ecological and cultural significance. Complex in its ecology, cultural history, and contemporary land-use, the boundary of Xetthecum is roughly delimited by the extent of the Greig Creek watershed, including the watercourse descending from Laughlin Lake to Retreat Cove, spanning residential and agricultural lands, protected and covenanted areas, and a public shore access.

Sitting at the narrowest point on the island, Xetthecum is located at one end of a shore-to-shore route used by the Penelakut peoples…

## Historic and Cultural Significance

Xetthecum holds profound historical and cultural significance for the Penelakut peoples, serving as a site for resource gathering as well as practices essential to the cultural fabric and spiritual growth of the community.

This land is of significant spiritual value, most notably at the site of the caves which were an important place for prayer and ceremony, and the merging of deer and human spirits. Regular and seasonal gatherings held in this area were part of the Penelakut's cultural fabric, with activities like blackberry picking and clam harvesting forming an integral part of daily life. 

Xetthecum was a primary resource-gathering area. Thiyaas (Florence James) and her family gathered an array of resources from this place, including berries, fruit, and shellfish. The bay provided not only essential foods but also medicinal resources, supporting both sustenance and ceremony for the community.

STORIES:

The resources found at Xetthecum sustained the Penelakut people and formed a core part of their diet and traditional practices. “We must protect the food sources. There are a lot of foods and medicines that are no longer there anymore.” Florence

Fish and Shellfish Harvesting

Littleneck clams ([skw'lhey](#taxon:Leukoma staminea)) were harvested during the spring and summer night tides. Other essential marine life, such as butter clams ([s-axwa'](#taxon:Saxidomus gigantea)), basket cockles ([stl'ula'um](#taxon:Clinocardium nuttallii)), and fish like dog (coho) salmon ([the'wun](#taxon:Oncorhynchus kisutch)), were gathered at Retreat Cove and Greig Creek. 

The shellfish were laid overtop of kelp (bull kelp, [q'am'](#taxon:Nereocystis luetkeana)) and then stepped on to get the water out; ironwood (oceanspray, [qethulhp](#taxon:Holodiscus discolor)) was singed in the fire, used to poke the clams and then stuck in the mud by the fire to cook them. Cedar bark ([xpey'](#taxon:Thuja plicata)) was made into string/rope which was used to string up clams by the fire. After they were cooked they would smoke the shellfish. 

Octopus ([xelex uwe](#taxon:Enteroctopus dofleini)) was speared, usually at night.

Smelts (surf smelt, [stsa'kwum](#taxon:Hypomesus pretiosus)) would go by and move in circles, the seagulls would try to get them. 

The fish had been restocked in Greig Creek just before the blasting happened near the mouth of Greig Creek (year?)

Medicinal Plants

Florence’s family would sometimes travel to Retreat Cove in the racing canoe. They would pull in near Retreat Island and Florence’s grandfather would walk to Laughlin Lake for medicine. 

The family would go to gather traditional medicines at Laughlin Lake, such as a plant that has features similar to corn, like husk and silk (not cattail).

Other Plants

Florence mentions gathering licorice fern ([tlu'siip](#taxon:Polypodium glycyrrhiza)) root from maple trees ([q'um'-unulhp](#taxon:Acer macrophyllum)) near Retreat Cove. 

Blackberries (trailing blackberry/[sqw''iil'muhw](#taxon:Rubus ursinus)) were picked all the way from the Lighthouse down to Retreat Cove. The family would wake at 5am with her granny and walk and collect the berries. 

Fireweed ([xats'et](#taxon:Chamaenerion angustifolium)), was used for stuffing sleep mats/beds (today it can be found along Retreat Cove Road and at Laughlin Lake). 

[Mushrooms](#taxon:Cantharellus formosus), (kwmusuliqw or mumsilit)

## Ecological Communities

The Xetthecum region is made up of several ecological communities including Forest, Woodland and Rock Outcrops, Freshwater and Marine. Each of these ecological communities are home to a diversity of species, many of which are of particular cultural significance to the Hul’q’umi’num’ speaking peoples.

## From the Lake to the Delta: Laughlin Lake

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

```

Laughlin Lake is part of a complex wetland ecosystem supporting a diversity of plant life, including culturally significant species like cattail ([stth’e’qun](#taxon:Typha angustifolia)) and fireweed ([xáts’et](#taxon:Chamaenerion angustifolium)). The riparian areas surrounding the lake are crucial for wildlife, offering habitat for species like black-tailed deer ([ha’put](#taxon:Odocoileus hemionus columbianus)) and great blue heron ([smuqw’a’](#taxon:Ardea herodias fannini)).
