## Introduction

Welcome to Xetthecum, an area on Galiano Island BC of ecological and cultural significance. Complex in its ecology, cultural history, and contemporary land-use, the boundary of Xetthecum is roughly delimited by the extent of the Greig Creek watershed, including the watercourse descending from Laughlin Lake to Retreat Cove, spanning residential and agricultural lands, protected and covenanted areas, and a public shore access.

Sitting at the narrowest point on the island, Xetthecum is located at one end of a shore-to-shore route used by the Penelakut peoples…

## Historic and Cultural Significance

Xetthecum holds profound historical and cultural significance for the Penelakut peoples, serving as a site for resource gathering as well as practices essential to the cultural fabric and spiritual growth of the community.

This land is of significant spiritual value, most notably at the site of the caves which were an important place for prayer and ceremony, and the merging of deer and human spirits. Regular and seasonal gatherings held in this area were part of the Penelakut's cultural fabric, with activities like blackberry picking and clam harvesting forming an integral part of daily life. 

Xetthecum was a primary resource-gathering area. Thiyaas (Florence James) and her family gathered an array of resources from this place, including berries, fruit, and shellfish. The bay provided not only essential foods but also medicinal resources, supporting both sustenance and ceremony for the community.

<div class="data-pane">
STORIES:

The resources found at Xetthecum sustained the Penelakut people and formed a core part of their diet and traditional practices. “We must protect the food sources. There are a lot of foods and medicines that are no longer there anymore.” Florence

Fish and Shellfish Harvesting

Littleneck clams ([skw'lhey](#taxon:Leukoma staminea)) were harvested during the spring and summer night tides. Other essential marine life, such as butter clams ([s-axwa'](#taxon:Saxidomus gigantea)), basket cockles ([stl'ula'um](#taxon:Clinocardium nuttallii)), and fish like dog (coho) salmon ([the'wun](#taxon:Oncorhynchus kisutch)), were gathered at Retreat Cove and Greig Creek. 

The shellfish were laid overtop of kelp (bull kelp, [q'am'](#taxon:Nereocystis luetkeana)) and then stepped on to get the water out; ironwood (oceanspray, [qethulhp](#taxon:Holodiscus discolor)) was singed in the fire, used to poke the clams and then stuck in the mud by the fire to cook them. Cedar bark ([xpey'](#taxon:Thuja plicata)) was made into string/rope which was used to string up clams by the fire. After they were cooked they would smoke the shellfish. 

Octopus ([xelex uwe](#taxon:Enteroctopus dofleini)) was speared, usually at night.

Smelts (surf smelt, [stsa'kwum](#taxon:Hypomesus pretiosus)) would go by and move in circles, the seagulls would try to get them. 

The fish had been restocked in Greig Creek just before the blasting happened near the mouth of Greig Creek (year?)

Medicinal Plants

Florence’s family would sometimes travel to Retreat Cove in the racing canoe. They would pull in near Retreat Island and Florence’s grandfather would walk to Laughlin Lake for medicine. 

The family would go to gather traditional medicines at Laughlin Lake, such as a plant that has features similar to corn, like husk and silk (not cattail).

Other Plants

Florence mentions gathering licorice fern ([tlu'siip](#taxon:Polypodium glycyrrhiza)) root from maple trees ([q'um'-unulhp](#taxon:Acer macrophyllum)) near Retreat Cove. 

Blackberries (trailing blackberry/[sqw''iil'muhw](#taxon:Rubus ursinus)) were picked all the way from the Lighthouse down to Retreat Cove. The family would wake at 5am with her granny and walk and collect the berries. 

Fireweed ([xats'et](#taxon:Chamaenerion angustifolium)), was used for stuffing sleep mats/beds (today it can be found along Retreat Cove Road and at Laughlin Lake). 

[Mushrooms](#taxon:Cantharellus formosus), (kwmusuliqw or mumsilit)

## Ecological Communities

The Xetthecum region is made up of several ecological communities including Forest, Woodland and Rock Outcrops, Freshwater and Marine. Each of these ecological communities are home to a diversity of species, many of which are of particular cultural significance to the Hul’q’umi’num’ speaking peoples.

Shaped by interactions between water, soil, terrain, climate and the multitudes of beings that live within them, forests are a sanctuary for hundreds of thousands of species of plants, fungi, mammals, birds, insects and microorganisms. Forests provide shelter, clean water, and food, the foundations for a complex web of life in which we are intricately connected. Humans have been stewarding forests on Galiano since time out of mind, in order to ensure key species that we depend on can flourish and help us thrive. 

Dry ridges or steep southwest facing slopes with nutrient poor, shallow soils tend to be dominated by a mix of gnarled [ts’sey](#taxon:Pseudotsuga menziesii menziesii) (Douglas-fir) and [qaanlhp](#taxon:Arbutus menziesii) (arbutus), and shrubby species such as [lulutth'sulhp](#taxon:Berberis aquifolium) (dull oregon grape) or [xwiinlhp](#taxon:Rosa gymnocarpa) (baldhip rose), all of which provide medicine. These drier ecological communities are mapped as woodlands in this map.

Moister forests are characterized by towering [ts’sey](#taxon:Pseudotsuga menziesii menziesii) (Douglas-fir) and robust [xpey’](#taxon:Thuja plicata) (western red cedar), which is known as the ‘tree of life’, as it can provide essential material for everything from ocean-worthy canoes, to rot-resistant buildings, beautiful carvings, and woven rain hats. The most valuable xpey’ for these purposes are old growth trees, which are allowed to grow slowly for hundreds of years in order to provide fine and clear-grained bark for weaving and wood for carving. Traditional Indigenous harvesting methods of only taking a strip of bark or plank of wood from one side can allow such trees to survive, heal and continue growing. The understory in this type of forest is dominated by plants that can grow in symbiosis with the fungicide xpey’ releases into the soil to discourage competition from other plants. This type of forest is often thick with [t'eqe'](#taxon:Gaultheria shallon) (salal) and [suniiulhp](#taxon:Berberis aquifolium) (tall oregon grape), both of which provide nutritious berries, as well as [sthxélem](#taxon:Polystichum munitum) (sword fern), which is a spiritually significant plant that also provides fiddleheads as a special winter treat. 

These older forests are models of complexity, exhibiting a vast diversity of composition (the parts), structure (the arrangement of the parts), and function (how the parts interact with one another). Big [ts'alhulhp](#taxon:Acer macrophyllum) (bigleaf maple) that are covered in moss offer habitat for other culturally significant species, such as [tl’usiip](#taxon:Polypodium glycyrrhiza) (licorice fern), which Florence James shared can be used as a sweetener: if one gently lifts the moss with your pinky to reveal the root, the licorice fern root can be rinsed, chopped up, mixed with berries and placed on a board in the sun to dry. If it is flipped the next day to dry the other side, this can be kept to have on hand.

In mature and old growth forests, trees are present in all stages of their life cycles including standing dead snags and fallen debris, large or small—providing critical habitat for culturally significant species such as [yuxwule'](#taxon:Haliaeetus leucocephalus) (bald eagle) and [ha'put](#taxon:Odocoileus hemionus columbianus) (black tailed deer). Forests are valued for hunting ha'put (deer) from September to October, although Florence James cautions that we should not hunt females or hunt after the rut, but wait until after the [ironwood](#taxon:Holodiscus discolor) (qethulhp) blooms turned brown. The first deer hunted was always shared as a ritual; each species had rules and rituals. It is tradition to bring an elder a piece of meat from hunting, just as one shared the first fish caught during seafood harvests.

</div>
<div class="tab-pane fade" id="freshwater" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="profile-tab">

Healthy wetlands, lakes and streams are havens for humans and wildlife alike, providing critical habitat and a source of freshwater. A diversity of plant life, bacteria and insects thrive in these ecosystems, forming complex food webs that support many culturally important species, such as stseelhtun (salmon). Thuqi' (sockeye salmon) and haan (pink salmon) are two types of salmon favoured by Indigenous community members on Galiano. In addition, the enhanced growth and forest structure found in riparian areas provides necessary cover for wildlife, which is also important for culturally significant activities such as hunting and birdwatching. [Ha'put](#taxon:Odocoileus hemionus columbianus) (black tailed deer) and [smuqw'a'](#taxon:Ardea herodias fannini) (great blue heron) depend on freshwater areas for food and water. 

Wetlands on Galiano include lakes, shallow water, swamps, marshes, wet meadows, fens, and bog communities, many of which are represented in the watershed that flows into Xetthecum. Swamps and riparian areas include flood-tolerant trees such as [xpey’](#taxon:Thuja plicata) (western red cedar) which “like to have their feet wet”, [kwulala'ulhp](#taxon:Alnus rubra) (red alder), whose inner bark offers a source of emergency food in the spring, and [swele’ulhp](#taxon:Salix lucida) (willow), which is useful for making fish traps. Other helpful plants that grow here include [stth'e'qun](#taxon:Typha angustifolia) (cattail) which provides a useful source of materials for both binding and insulation, [sxum'xum'](#taxon:Equisetum arvense) (horsetail), which makes a yellow brown dye and [ts'a'kw'a'](#taxon:Lysichiton americanus) (skunk cabbage) which can be used to wrap food to keep it fresh. These areas are prized for berry-picking and gathering other edible and medicinal plants such as [lila’](#taxon:Rubus spectabilis) (salmonberry), [t'uqwum'](#taxon:Rubus parviflorus) (thimbleberry), [t'eqe'](#taxon:Gaultheria shallon) (salal), [suniiulhp](#taxon:Berberis aquifolium) (oregon grape), [sqw'uqwtsus](#taxon:Vaccinium parvifolium) (red huckleberry) and me’uwhulhp (Labrador tea).

Colonial settlers began to alter Galiano’s landscape in the late 1800’s in ways that were very different from the strategies used by pre-contact First Nations communities. Instead of respecting the integrity of streams, wetlands and riparian areas and honouring the role that [sqwul'ew'](#taxon:Castor canadensis) (beaver) play in revitalizing freshwater ecosystems, these areas have been focal points for resource extraction, agriculture, logging, construction, transportation and waste disposal. 

Hwtalonēts (Greig Creek) does not currently support large populations of salmon. In fact, there are no sea-run salmon or trout populations currently spawning in the island’s streams. There are, however, resident cutthroat trout and stickleback populations that have persisted in a number of our creeks. These fish are no longer able to make it to the ocean because of barriers such as waterfalls, ditched agricultural fields and dams. Efforts to re-establish Coho and Chum populations in Greig Creek have been taking place, mainly through stream bank restoration and stocking, in part through the local school caring for and releasing salmon fry on an annual basis. This is a significant experience for Indigenous and non-Indigenous children alike on Galiano. Habitat for a resident cutthroat trout population in Murchison creek has been improved through the creation of off-channel ponds and the placement of large woody debris within the channel.

Surrounded by water, the residents, visitors and non-resident property owners of Galiano Island see the ocean as intrinsic to living and loving life on this island. Sightings of [q'ul-lhanamutsum](#taxon:Orcinus orca) (orca whales) and other marine mammals are treasured, and ocean-going transportation is key, but for many community members, the ocean is first and foremost a source of food and livelihood. Both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people on Galiano enjoy fish such as thuqi' (sockeye salmon), haan (pink salmon), tuqwtuqw (red snapper) and t’q’as (rockfish in general). Also prized are [tl'uxwtl'uxw](#taxon:Magallana gigas) (oysters), [s-axwa'](#taxon:Saxidomus gigantea) (clams), kwuneem'mun', (scallops), [ey'x](#taxon:Metacarcinus magister) (dungeness crabs), [thikwt](#taxon:Apostichopus californicus) (sea cucumber) and seaweeds & algaes such as lhuq'us (red laver). Florence James shared that e s-hw (seal) has also been prized as a dark meat. 

Xetthecum (Retreat Cove/Island) is one of the few marine locations on the shoreline of Galiano itself that has been an important place for fishing and harvesting shellfish. Its desirability as a habitat for rockfish in particular has since become so notable that it has been designated a marine protected area—in which fishing is banned—in order to conserve these long-lived species that are slow to reproduce.  As the tide is not too fast, Xetthecum was once also a good area for other creatures, such as clams, [pun'eq'](#taxon:Panopea generosa) (geoduck) and dog fish. It is important that community members are able to harvest and consume these foods without getting sick, therefore environmental health of the ocean is vital.

Culturally significant beaches and shorelines on Galiano Island, such as those near Xetthecum are used as places to congregate for picnics, social events, ceremonial sites, and as food gathering sites by local First Nations peoples. Bays, inlets, and coves like Xetthecum are also a place of safe harbour during storms, or places to moor one's boat during winters.

Many (if not all) of the Indigenous families associated with Galiano have been fishing since time out of mind. The Seafood Fest has been an extremely significant annual cultural event for decades primarily because so many of the island’s inhabitants have been passing down the skills, knowledge and secret locations of where to find the best sources of seafood for generations. Unfortunately, due to overfishing, destruction of marine habitat, pollution and other industrial causes, the bounty of the sea has become so limited that few members of the next generation can make a living fishing, and most of the menu for the Seafood Fest now has to be purchased from elsewhere. 

In the past, no one would ever reveal the locations of where to harvest seafood, but now this is merely a list of where these creatures once were. Locations of significance include Porlier Pass for rockfish, Pinnacle Rock on the south side of Porlier Pass for lingcod, and Walker Hook off of Saltspring for rockfish. As for salmon, Cable Bay was once a good location for chum salmon, as was Enterprise Reef off of Mayne Island, and off Valdes Island, but other fishing areas that have been key for Indigenous Galiano community members in the past hundred years are much farther away, necessitating long periods of time that families are separated. The closest of these locations include the west coast of Vancouver Island such as Jordan River, Race Rocks, San Juan Harbour near Port Renfrew, and areas near River’s Inlet to the Skeena.

<div class="tab-pane fade" id="woodlands" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="contact-tab">

Often known as Garry Oak Meadow ecosystems, a decolonized perspective prioritizes not the largest or    most visually obvious species, P'hwulhp (Garry oak - named for a Hudson’s Bay Company officer, Nicholas Garry, by botanist David Douglas), but instead the most culturally significant species, speenhw (blue camas). Fields of speenhw have been cultivated for thousands of years by First Nations Camas Keepers throughout this region, creating a unique ecosystem that is not found anywhere else in the world. Like speenhw, stl’ults’uluqw’us (chocolate lily / tiger lily) are very beautiful and edible. Other culturally significant species include t’uliqw’ulhp (yarrow) and q'uxmin (barestem desert parsley / wild celery), which are prized for their medicinal qualities.

Penelakut elder Thiyaas (Florence James) calls this type of ecosystem shthuliim: “a beautiful meadow with cushions for your feet made of moss, tender growth, grass…” She adds that p'hwulhp (Garry Oak) was made crooked by the creator so that its branches are useless to people and it will be left alone, and mentions that the presence of p'hwulhp is evidence that the land is being taken care of. Thiyaas told us that pheasant, quail, and grouse were a lot more abundant in these woodland meadow environments, and that they used to be a regular part of Indigenous people’s diets in this area. Like speenhw, the bulbs of stl’ults’uluqw’us (chocolate lily / tiger lily) are very beautiful and edible when cooked. Thiyaas used to collect fawn lilies and ti'tuqw-el'tun' (lady slippers) for her mother, as her mother would eat the bulbs. “That was just our joy”... but there is not enough to collect anymore.” Other culturally significant species include t’uliqw’ulhp (yarrow) and q'uxmin (barestem desert parsley / wild celery), which are prized for their medicinal qualities.

As in other locations throughout Southern Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands, speenhw have been cultivated since time immemorial because they are a culturally, economically and nutritionally significant staple food. The beautiful purple flowers that bloom in the spring are merely the tip of the iceberg, as this nutritious bulb requires human intervention to thrive through regular, controlled burning and digging to harvest bulbs and aerate the soil. Control of camas meadows have fueled community growth, trade, conflict and the expression of matrilineal rights and responsibilities for generations beyond count. As control over these camas meadows has been taken away from Indigenous knowledge keepers, the species that depend upon them have become endangered, and traditional management practices are only now being recovered and re-instituted in some areas.

Camas meadows on Galiano are critically important to maintaining the island’s biodiversity. “Together, Garry oak and associated ecosystems are home to more plant species than any other terrestrial ecosystem in coastal British Columbia. Many of these species occur nowhere else in Canada…Collectively, Garry oak ecosystems are among the most endangered in Canada – less than 5% of the original habitat remains in a near-natural condition.” (GOERT, 2003) On Galiano, Garry oak and associated ecosystems are generally limited to steep, south-southwest facing slopes and shoreline areas. They tend to occur in areas with very dry shallow soils or that are too exposed to wind and sun for forest ecosystems to flourish, as without active human cultivation, more desirable areas have been taken over by other plants. 

In addition to p'hwulhp (Garry oaks) which provide medicinal bark, camas meadow ecosystems may also include scattered qaanlhp (arbutus), which provide medicinal bark and leaves as well as edible berries. While they prefer wetter areas, occasionally other trees can survive in camas meadows, such as ts'alhulhp (bigleaf maple) which can provide leaves to flavour camas pit cook feasts, edible flowers and medicinal shoots, sap and cambium, and ts’sey (Douglas-fir), which is valued for many uses such as tools, poles and its pitch. The garry oak understory, often referred to as meadowland or savannah, is largely comprised of grasses, forbs and shrubby vegetation. 

#### Threats 

Like our older forests, camas meadow / Garry oak ecosystems are endangered. Over 100 species of plant, mammal, reptile, bird, butterfly and other insects are listed as vulnerable in these ecosystems (GOERT, 2003). This status is due to a number of factors including colonialism, construction, agriculture, fire suppression, and invasive exotic species. Unlike among the lək̓ʷəŋən people of the Songhees and Esquimalt First Nations in what is also known as Victoria, there have not been Camas Keepers on Galiano for several generations. As knowledge of this incredibly valuable staple food must be held close, it could have taken only one or two deaths of a Camas Keeper and her apprentice by smallpox or some other effect of colonization, to wipe out active cultivation of the Camas meadows on Galiano. However, speenhw are a hardy, beautiful plant that can self-reproduce through both seeds and bulbs, so they have survived in numbers through the creation of parks, such as Bellhouse. 

With construction and the colonial suppression of fire, however, also came the spread of exotic plant species such as Scotch broom, orchard grass and velvet grass. These and other fast growing, aggressive alien species were brought to Galiano by humans from as far away as Europe. Exotics have managed to thrive in the sunny open meadows characteristic of the Garry oak ecosystem. These species tend to choke out our native vegetation, alter soil conditions, and change natural processes needed by microorganisms, insects, and other wildlife. The spread of invasive exotic plants and decline of native plants in Garry oak and associated ecosystems has also been linked to high levels of herbivore grazing (Gonzales, 2004), such as by Galiano’s large resident deer population or domestic livestock. 

Residential construction has had the greatest impact on Galiano’s camas meadow ecosystems. This is due to their location on south and southwest facing slopes coinciding with the most sought after waterfront and view real estate on the Island. Fire suppression is also having an effect. Prevention of natural fires on these sites, combined with the cessation of First Nations burning and cultivation has in places created a condition more conducive to forest growth. The invasion or progression of young Douglas-fir trees and common forest understory species out into camas meadows has been observed in several locations on Galiano. Most of the remaining camas meadow ecosystems have survived on exposed slopes that are too steep for residences, with soils too shallow to support a forest.

Laughlin Lake is part of a complex wetland ecosystem supporting a diversity of plant life, including culturally significant species like cattail ([stth’e’qun](#taxon:Typha angustifolia)) and fireweed ([xáts’et](#taxon:Chamaenerion angustifolium)). The riparian areas surrounding the lake are crucial for wildlife, offering habitat for species like black-tailed deer ([ha’put](#taxon:Odocoileus hemionus columbianus)) and great blue heron ([smuqw’a’](#taxon:Ardea herodias fannini)).

Greig Creek was once home to abundant salmon. Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities on the island are now working together to restore Coho and Chum salmon populations in the creek, primarily through stream bank restoration and salmon fry release by local schools. This activity is an educational and cultural experience for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous children.

The Greig Creek delta was once home to significant clam gardens, which were an important food source for the Penelakut people, and clam digging was an important cultural activity. Due to ecological disruption caused by resource extraction, development, logging, and agriculture, the clam gardens have been replaced by a large and invasive oyster bed which is visible at low tide.

## Life at the Cove: Caves

The caves at Xetthecum have significant spiritual and cultural significance for the Hul’q’umi’num’ speaking peoples of this region. Retreat Cove, including its caves, served as a location for private ceremonies for the people of Penelakut. Penelakut elders have emphasized the need to protect and respect these important cultural spaces; until now, the caves have not been protected and are at risk of being damaged by vandalism and overuse as a result of tourism.

## Life at the Cove: Retreat Cove

“I used to spend time up in Xetthecum with my grandparents visiting with friends and picking berries and fruit. Sometimes we would anchor in there if we had to when we were on the boats.” Rosemary Georgeson

Xetthecum was  important for social and cultural gatherings, as well as for traditional activities such as fishing and clam digging. (Lorne Silvey - find exact quote)


As a marine location, Retreat Cove is a habitat for rockfish and has been significant for fishing, but it is now a marine protected area to conserve these species due to overfishing and habitat destruction.

## Life at the Cove: Eelgrass Beds

Lying near the mouths of Greig Creek (Hwta’loonèts ) and Davidson Creek (hulq?) ,the eelgrass beds at Xetthecum are an important marine ecological community. [Eelgrass](#taxon:Zostera marina) is a foundational species that creates a complex habitat, thereby providing shelter for a large number of diverse species. 

Seagrass ecosystems are an important link between the ocean and the land. Lying at the wide mouths of estuaries and in the grey silts and sands of the intertidal and foreshore, these tidal meadows are beautiful and nourishing places where sunlight, freshwater, saltwater , and sediments combine. This unique intermingling gives rise to food webs that allow life of all kinds to flourish, from microscopic bacteria and algae to larger animals like crabs, fishes and birds (13). 

The eelgrass beds at Xetthecum form a critical nursery for many species’ young including juvenile salmon and flatfish, and serve as a spawning ground for herring (2,3). They also provide rich foraging habitat for numerous invertebrates and many larger creatures, including heron (smuq’wa) and geese (ey’x (4,5), and are home to the Hooded nudibranch or sea slug (q’uyatl’un).

Other functions of seagrass meadows include filtering excess nutrients from the nearshore environment, preventing shoreline erosion, and storing carbon (3). Eelgrass meadows, kelp beds and coastal marshes are massive carbon sinks, absorbing CO2 at a rate of up to 90 times that of forests on land (from the video). Protection and conservation of these areas is thus important not only for biodiversity and marine species health, but also for worldwide climate change mitigation.

The concerns raised about challenges in fishing due to coho fishery closure and the impact of logging industry hint at the need for preservation efforts and the articulation of a future vision to sustain these resources. [Jeannine’s interview]

Florence emphasises the need to protect and conserve resources, suggesting a future vision that involves sustainable practices and preserving traditional knowledge for future generations.

Xetthecum is a vital marine sanctuary on Galiano Island. It's a protected area crucial for preserving rockfish and shellfish populations, ensuring their continued existence for future generations.

Galiano's ecosystems, including Xetthecum, from lush forests to thriving marine environments, are interconnected and crucial for sustaining life. They provide resources, shelter, and inspiration, forming the foundation of the island's health and eco-cultural identity.

Efforts to preserve Galiano's natural heritage are ongoing. Restoration initiatives, coupled with the desire to uphold Indigenous wisdom and practices, aim to safeguard the island's resources for future generations.

Efforts are ongoing to protect and restore the island's ecosystems. However, colonial practices, invasive species, and industrial impacts threaten these efforts. Both Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities are actively involved in preserving and reconnecting with the land through various educational initiatives and conservation projects, aiming for a sustainable future vision for Galiano Island.
