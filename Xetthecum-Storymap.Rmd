## Introduction

Welcome to Xetthecum, an area on Galiano Island BC of ecological and cultural significance. Complex in its ecology, cultural history, and contemporary land-use, the boundary of Xetthecum is roughly delimited by the extent of the Greig Creek watershed, including the watercourse descending from Laughlin Lake to Retreat Cove, spanning residential and agricultural lands, protected and covenanted areas, and a public shore access.

Sitting at the narrowest point on the island, Xetthecum is located at one end of a shore-to-shore route used by the Penelakut peoples…

## Historic and Cultural Significance

Xetthecum holds profound historical and cultural significance for the Penelakut peoples, serving as a site for resource gathering as well as practices essential to the cultural fabric and spiritual growth of the community.

This land is of significant spiritual value, most notably at the site of the caves which were an important place for prayer and ceremony, and the merging of deer and human spirits. Regular and seasonal gatherings held in this area were part of the Penelakut's cultural fabric, with activities like blackberry picking and clam harvesting forming an integral part of daily life. 

Xetthecum was a primary resource-gathering area. Thiyaas (Florence James) and her family gathered an array of resources from this place, including berries, fruit, and shellfish. The bay provided not only essential foods but also medicinal resources, supporting both sustenance and ceremony for the community.

STORIES:

The resources found at Xetthecum sustained the Penelakut people and formed a core part of their diet and traditional practices. “We must protect the food sources. There are a lot of foods and medicines that are no longer there anymore.” Florence

Fish and Shellfish Harvesting

Littleneck clams (skw'lhey) were harvested during the spring and summer night tides. Other essential marine life, such as butter clams (s-axwa'), basket cockles (stl'ula'um), and fish like dog (coho) salmon (the'wun), were gathered at Retreat Cove and Greig Creek. 

The shellfish were laid overtop of kelp (bull kelp, q'am') and then stepped on to get the water out; ironwood (oceanspray, qethulhp) was singed in the fire, used to poke the clams and then stuck in the mud by the fire to cook them. Cedar bark (xpey') was made into string/rope which was used to string up clams by the fire. After they were cooked they would smoke the shellfish. 

Octopus (xelex uwe) was speared, usually at night.

Smelts (surf smelt, stsa'kwum) would go by and move in circles, the seagulls would try to get them. 

The fish had been restocked in Greig Creek just before the blasting happened near the mouth of Greig Creek (year?)

Medicinal Plants

Florence’s family would sometimes travel to Retreat Cove in the racing canoe. They would pull in near Retreat Island and Florence’s grandfather would walk to Laughlin Lake for medicine. 

The family would go to gather traditional medicines at Laughlin Lake, such as a plant that has features similar to corn, like husk and silk (not cattail).

Other Plants

Florence mentions gathering licorice fern (tlu'siip) root from maple trees (q'um'-unulhp) near Retreat Cove. 

Blackberries (trailing blackberry/sqw''iil'muhw or Himalayann blackberry, or cutleaf blackberry?) were picked all the way from the Lighthouse down to Retreat Cove. The family would wake at 5am with her granny and walk and collect the berries. 

Fireweed (xats'et), was used for stuffing sleep mats/beds (today it can be found along Retreat Cove Road and at Laughlin Lake).

## From the Lake to the Delta: Laughlin Lake

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source("scripts/laughlin_map_script.R")
laughlinMap <- mx_laughlin_map()
laughlinMap
```

Laughlin Lake is part of a complex wetland ecosystem supporting a diversity of plant life, including culturally significant species like cattail (stth’e’qun) and fireweed (xáts’et). The riparian areas surrounding the lake are crucial for wildlife, offering habitat for species like black-tailed deer (ha’put) and great blue heron (smuqw’a’).

```

Greig Creek was once home to abundant salmon. Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities on the island are now working together to restore Coho and Chum salmon populations in the creek, primarily through stream bank restoration and salmon fry release by local schools. This activity is an educational and cultural experience for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous children.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source("scripts/delta_map_script.R")
deltaMap <- mx_delta_map()
deltaMap
```

The Greig Creek delta was once home to significant clam gardens, which were an important food source for the Penelakut people, and clam digging was an important cultural activity. Due to ecological disruption caused by resource extraction, development, logging, and agriculture, the clam gardens have been replaced by a large and invasive oyster bed which is visible at low tide.

## Life at the Cove: Caves

The caves at Xetthecum have significant spiritual and cultural significance for the Hul’q’umi’num’ speaking peoples of this region. Retreat Cove, including its caves, served as a location for private ceremonies for the people of Penelakut. Penelakut elders have emphasized the need to protect and respect these important cultural spaces; until now, the caves have not been protected and are at risk of being damaged by vandalism and overuse as a result of tourism.

```

“I used to spend time up in Xetthecum with my grandparents visiting with friends and picking berries and fruit. Sometimes we would anchor in there if we had to when we were on the boats.” Rosemary Georgeson

Xetthecum was  important for social and cultural gatherings, as well as for traditional activities such as fishing and clam digging. (Lorne Silvey - find exact quote)


As a marine location, Retreat Cove is a habitat for rockfish and has been significant for fishing, but it is now a marine protected area to conserve these species due to overfishing and habitat destruction.



## Life at the Cove: Eelgrass Beds

Lying near the mouths of Greig Creek (Hwta’loonèts ) and Davidson Creek (hulq?) ,the eelgrass beds at Xetthecum are an important marine ecological community. Eelgrass (Zostera marina) is a foundational species that creates a complex habitat, thereby providing shelter for a large number of diverse species. 

Seagrass ecosystems are an important link between the ocean and the land. Lying at the wide mouths of estuaries and in the grey silts and sands of the intertidal and foreshore, these tidal meadows are beautiful and nourishing places where sunlight, freshwater, saltwater , and sediments combine. This unique intermingling gives rise to food webs that allow life of all kinds to flourish, from microscopic bacteria and algae to larger animals like crabs, fishes and birds (13). 

The eelgrass beds at Xetthecum form a critical nursery for many species’ young including juvenile salmon and flatfish, and serve as a spawning ground for herring (2,3). They also provide rich foraging habitat for numerous invertebrates and many larger creatures, including heron (smuq’wa) and geese (ey’x (4,5), and are home to the Hooded nudibranch or sea slug (q’uyatl’un).

Other functions of seagrass meadows include filtering excess nutrients from the nearshore environment, preventing shoreline erosion, and storing carbon (3). Eelgrass meadows, kelp beds and coastal marshes are massive carbon sinks, absorbing CO2 at a rate of up to 90 times that of forests on land (from the video). Protection and conservation of these areas is thus important not only for biodiversity and marine species health, but also for worldwide climate change mitigation.
