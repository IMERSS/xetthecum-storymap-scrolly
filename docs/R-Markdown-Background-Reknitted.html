<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This project hosts a skeleton structure suitable for building out and
publishing a map-based scrollytelling interface based on R Markdown. You
can build your own scrollytelling interface using R and R Markdown,
using free tools such as git, R and R studio, and publish and host it
for free using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
<p>This first section renders a basic vector map layer represented as an
ESRI Shapefile, perhaps <a href="https://docs.qgis.org/3.22/en/docs/user_manual/managing_data_source/supported_data.html#esri-shapefile-format">exported
from a GIS system such as QGIS</a>.</p>
